# Deep Learning with C# and CNTK

![Deep Learning with C# and CNTK](./assets/DLR.jpg)

This repository contains all course assignments of my **Deep Learning with C# and CNTK** course and will get you up to speed with Microsoft's amazing Cognitive Toolkit machine learning library.

By working through the code examples, you will learn how to design, train, and evaluate complex neural networks and machine learning models with simple C# code. I'll provide you with all the code, libraries, and data sets you need to get started.

Please note that this repository only contains code examples with no additional support. 

If you prefer a full-featured e-learning experience with live coaching, please check out my online course here:
